1. Architecture Analysis
Type:

Monolithic web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
Structure:

Entry Point: index.js sets up the Express app, middleware, session, and routes.
Routing:
Book-related routes in routes/books.js
Authentication in routes/auth.js
Database Layer:
PostgreSQL accessed via db/db.js using the pg library.
Views:
EJS templates in views/ for rendering HTML.
Static Assets:
Served from public/, including CSS.
Session Management:

User sessions handled via express-session for login/logout and access control.
2. Technologies & Implementation Approach
Technologies Used:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL
Templating: EJS
Session Management: express-session
HTTP Requests: axios (for fetching book covers)
Styling: Bootstrap 5, Bootstrap Icons, custom CSS
ORM/DB Access: Raw SQL queries via pg (no ORM)
Other: body-parser for form data
Implementation Highlights:

Authentication:
Simple session-based login/logout, password stored in plaintext (see improvements).
Book CRUD:
Users can add, edit, delete, and view books.
Book cover images fetched from Open Library API using ISBN.
Search & Sort:
Books can be searched by title, author, or ISBN.
Sorting by title, author, date read, or rating.
Access Control:
Only logged-in users can add/edit/delete books.
Views:
Clean separation of layout via partials (header.ejs, footer.ejs).
Conditional rendering based on authentication state.
3. Improvements & Recommendations
Security
Password Storage:
Current: Plaintext passwords in DB.
Improve: Use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing.
Input Validation:
Add server-side validation and sanitization for all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS.
CSRF Protection:
Implement CSRF tokens for forms to prevent cross-site request forgery.
Code Quality & Structure
Error Handling:
Improve error messages for users (currently sends raw errors or plain text).
Add error pages (404, 500) for better UX.
DRY Principle:
Some code (e.g., fetching/sorting books) could be refactored into reusable functions.
Environment Variables:
Move DB credentials and session secrets to .env files using dotenv.
Features & UX
Registration:
Add user registration (currently only login is present).
Pagination:
Add pagination for book lists to improve performance and usability.
Profile Management:
Allow users to update their profile/password.
Book Cover Handling:
Cache cover URLs or images to reduce repeated API calls.
Responsive Design:
Ensure all views are fully responsive on mobile devices.
Testing & Deployment
Testing:
Add unit and integration tests for routes and database logic.
Deployment:
Add a Procfile or Dockerfile for easier deployment.
Documentation:
Add a README with setup instructions, features, and screenshots.
Summary:
Your project demonstrates a solid grasp of full-stack fundamentals, session management, and external API integration. The main improvements are around security (password hashing, input validation), code maintainability, and user experience enhancements.
